      This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend <a href="#">Venice Park</a>. A lawyer per excellence and an advocate for the common man

      Today, the park service is a melting point for all struggles emanating in the mega city (Venice) in <b>2010</b>, a park in Venice was named
      after him by <b>Venice government</b>

    <p>I went to the park to take picture for my photography assignment. i'm realy proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Venice Park</p>
    <p>
      The park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because ot the Venice Park opportunists. It required maintenance too. but
      overall i loved it
